# Reflect App: User Testing Plan

### 1. Objectives
* Test the usability of the core app flow (Concept -> Prompt -> Edit -> Response -> Reflect).
* Assess the user's emotional connection to the generated images.
* Gather feedback on the UI/UX (is it calming, intuitive, and accessible?).

### 2. Target Users
* 3-5 test users (e.g., fellow students, friends).
* *Bonus:* Anyone with an interest in journaling, mindfulness, or mental wellness.

### 3. Test Tasks
We will ask users to complete the following tasks:
1.  **Task 1:** Open the app and start a new reflection.
2.  **Task 2:** Choose the "A Safe Space" concept.
3.  **Task 3:** Select an emotion (e.g., "Anxiety") and a style (e.g., "Watercolor").
4.  **Task 4:** Submit the prompt and review the 4 generated images.
5.  **Task 5:** Select their favorite image.
6.  **Task 6:** Write a short journal entry about why they chose that image.

### 4. Feedback Questions
After they finish, we will ask:
* "On a scale of 1-5, how easy was the app to use?"
* "Did the generated image match the emotion you chose?"
* "What did you like most about the app?"
* "What did you find confusing or frustrating?"
* "Would you use this app again for self-reflection?"
