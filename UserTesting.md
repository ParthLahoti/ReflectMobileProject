Reflect Mobile App - User Testing Plan

This document outlines the plan for conducting a small-scale pilot user test, as specified in the project brief.

1. Objectives

The goal of this user test is to gather qualitative feedback on the app's core user flow. We want to answer:

Usability: Is the app easy and intuitive to navigate? Do users understand what to do on each screen?

Value: Do users find the concept of turning emotions into AI art helpful or engaging?

Clarity: Is the "Prompt Building" process (selecting an emotion and style) clear?

Bugs: Are there any obvious bugs or crashes in the main flow?

2. Methodology

Participants: We will conduct a small-scale pilot test with 3-5 users. Participants will be fellow students who are not familiar with the project.

Format: The test will be an in-person, moderated session. One team member will give the user the tasks, and another will observe and take notes.

Setup: The test will be conducted on a single Android device with the "Reflect" app installed.

3. Test Script (User Tasks)

Users will be given the following sequence of tasks and asked to "think aloud" as they perform them.

Task 1: Generate an Image

"Imagine you are feeling joyful and want to express it."

"Open the app and generate an image that represents joy in a 'Watercolor' style."

Task 2: Edit the Prompt

"Before you submit, please add the words 'with bright colors' to the end of your prompt."

"Now, submit the prompt."

Task 3: Select and Reflect

"From the four images generated, tap on the one you like the most."

"On the final screen, write a short journal entry about why you picked that image."

4. Post-Test Questions

After the tasks are complete, we will ask the user these follow-up questions:

On a scale of 1 to 5, how easy was the app to use?

What was the most confusing part of the process?

What did you like most about the app?

Would you use an app like this for your own wellness or journaling?

5. (Template) Insights & Recommendations

(This section will be filled out after testing is complete. Below are expected examples.)

Insight: Users were unsure what to do on the ResponseScreen and tapped randomly.

Recommendation: Make the "Select an image" text larger and more prominent.

Insight: Users wanted to generate more than 4 images.

Recommendation: Add a "Regenerate" button to the ResponseScreen in a future version.

Insight: Users found the "Pick a Style" dropdown confusing.

Recommendation: Consider replacing the dropdown with a visual grid of style examples.
